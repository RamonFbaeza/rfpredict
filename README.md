            *
          from (
            select
                user_pseudo_id,
                event_name
            from
                  `ramonfbaeza-ga4.analytics_xxxxxxx.events_202201*`)
          pivot (
            count(*)

Then, **you will get your model trainned and you will see the model score**. You will also be able to upload a new file to predict conversion probability for each client (user_pseudo_id). **You will be able to download an excel/csv** file with all the predictions.
